    <p class="info"><em>About Me</em><br> I am an artist native to Santa Fe, New Mexico. A culuter that desires Art, Turquoise, 
        and green chile. It is an inspiring and spicy place with purple sunsets and bright orange sunrises. 
        It allows for the imagination to play, grow, and adventure into the unseen, overlooked, and forgotten. A simple charcoal 
        drawing of a bell pepper can be tranquil when the eye is forced to see the prespective of the artist. 
        Is the bell pepper red? Is it green? How can one drawing be so different from person to person? The beauty
        of art is on the eye of the beholder as well as the answers. The artisit job is to give you the questions.</p>

    <p class="info"><em>Wood Art</em><br> My wood art is my newest addition to styles of art. The smell of the wood buring is claming. Reminds me of my grandpa smoking 
        his tabaco pipe, sweet and smokey. The variations of wood art are exciting. From wood burning, painting on wood, or carving wooden
        scupltures. </p>

    <p class="info"><em>Charcoal Art</em><br> My charcoal paintings helped me understand different shades of black and white. How it is not all black and white, but grays and variations
        of light and darkness. Reminds me that things are not always how they seem. I also like black and white paintings because it allows
        the viewer to imagin what the image looks like in color. Can someone tell if the bell pepper is red or green by just it's looks? Maybe...
    </p>

    <p class="info"><em>Acrylic Art</em><br> My Acrylic paintins are my oldest form of style. I find this type to be most challenging. As I feel I am great with shading in black
        and white. Color brings a whole new concept to shading. Muliple colors can go into shading the color red. From the light side to
        the dark side. Still a challenge I have yet to accomplish.
